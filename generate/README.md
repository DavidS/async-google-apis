# async-google-apis: Generator

This python script (collection) generates Rust code from Google's API discovery
documents. The easiest way to use the code is to copy the generated code to your
crate.

Make sure to import the `async-google-apis-common` crate in your `Cargo.toml`.
Please read the `README` in that crate for further advice.
